Tracklist Scrobbler is an application that allows you to scrobble a podcast's tracklist to last.fm.

It currently is able to parse the following podcasts' tracklists:
- Trance Around The World
- A State of Trance
- The Gareth Emery Podcast
- Corsten's Countdown
- Moor Music
- 3Voor12 Draait
- The Arnej Podcast
- Tiësto's Club Life Podcast

Future ideas:
- Retrieve a podcast's tracklist from the internet automatically before parsing
- Implement a (useful) statusbar
